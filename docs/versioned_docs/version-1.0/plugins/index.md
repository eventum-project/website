# Plugins

## Plugins usage

To use specific plugin, in configuration file you have to refer to it by its name. Each plugin has its own set of parameters. Input plugins also have time modes that they support. There are input plugins that support both `sample` and `live` modes.

To develop new custom plugins you can explore example implementations in the official **[Eventum plugins repository](https://github.com/Eventum-Generatives/EventumPlugins)**.
